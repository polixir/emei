    Integrate 1-D or N-D system of ODEs using 4-th order Runge-Kutta.
    This is a toy implementation which may be useful if you find
    yourself stranded on a system w/o scipy.  Otherwise use
    :func:`scipy.integrate`.

    Args:
        derivs: the derivative of the system and has the signature ``dy = derivs(yi)``
        y0: initial state vector
        t: sample times
        cfg: additional arguments passed to the derivative function
        kwargs: additional keyword arguments passed to the derivative function

    Example 1 ::
        ### 2D system
        def derivs(x):
            d1 =  x[0] + 2*x[1]

    If you have access to scipy, you should probably be using the
    scipy.integrate tools rather than this function.
    This would then require re-adding the time variable to the signature of derivs.
